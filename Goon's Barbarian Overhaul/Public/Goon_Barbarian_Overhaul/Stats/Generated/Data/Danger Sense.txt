// ==================================== Danger Sense ====================================
// Bug Fix: Conditions expanded to cover status groups for Blinded and Incapacitated conditions, instead of just Blinded and Knocked Out specifically.
// Bug Fix: The description now matches the functionality; it was never limited to Saving Throws against traps, spells and surfaces, it just gives plain no frills attached Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws. 
// TODO: I may look at changing it to be RAW in the future, but it's easier to just edit the description for now.
